# **UCI** - *Advanced Web Programming*

## Project : **The new r/Place**

The goal is to create a big canva, full of empty pixels. 
Each user need to create an account in order to add a pixel of the color of his choice, where he want on the canva.
He can add a pixel each 5 minutes (this could be changed in the future)

The colors will be defined before, there will be like 10 colors.

**Why this project ?**

- We love the idea that a group of people from anywhere will be able to create a big canva.
- But also, we don't know what can happen, and the future will tell us what will happen on the canva.
